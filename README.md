Abstract

INTRODUCTION Acquired post-traumatic tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an uncommon entity requiring early diagnosis. Among the many strategies in surgical management, we report a case successfully treated with a single-stage tracheal resection and esophageal repair with platysma myocutaneous interposition flap. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 24-year-old man had a motor vehicle accident with head injury and cerebral contusion who required mechanical ventilation support. Three weeks later, he developed hypersecretion, and recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia. The chest computed tomography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and bronchoscopy revealed a large TEF diameter of 3 cm at 4.5 cm from carina. Single-stage tracheal resection with primary end-to-end anastomosis and esophageal repair with platysma myocutaneous interposition flap was performed. A contrast esophagography was done on post-operative day 7 and revealed no leakage. He was discharged on post-operative day 10. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy at 1 month revealed patient esophageal lumen. At present he is doing well without any evidence of complications such as esophageal stricture or fistula. DISCUSSION There are many choices of myocutaneous muscle flaps in trachea and esophageal closure or reinforcement. The platysma myocutaneous flap interposition is simple with the advantage of reduced bulkiness. Concern on the vascular supply is that flap should be elevated with the deep adipofascial tissue under the platysma to ensure that the flap survival is not threatened. CONCLUSION The treatment of acquired TEF with platysma myocutaneous flap is an alternative procedure for a large uncomplicated TEF as it is effective, technically ease, minimal donor site defect and yields good surgical results. © 2014 The Authors.
